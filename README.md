# the_rust_book

This project has been developed following the examples in the book The Rust 
Programming Language, 2nd Edition by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols. The code 
is organized in a way that the project will contain all the code instead of 
separate projects. There is only one main() function and each concept is code 
in its own module contains one or more functions. Those modules are imported 
in the main() function to bring them in-scope.
